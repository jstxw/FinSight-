- Added a wallet icon next to the FinSight title for visual branding.
- Increased the title size, made it bold and white for better contrast.

- Made the menu button more visually distinct and consistent with the new color scheme.
- Ensured the navbar sits below any header and does not overlap when scrolling.

## 3. Side Menu Improvements
